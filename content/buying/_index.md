      Those titles make you sound important. But a home title really is important. 
      It establishes that you actually own your home, free and clear from the 
      claims of others. Someone needs to do some homework to make sure that 
      the home you are buying is free of judgments, liens, bankruptcies, 
      and other potential snafus. That someone is your title company.

    title: Are you sure?

      In the vast majority of home sales, the due diligence of the title
      company assures your sale is problem-free. But with such a big commitment,
      you need to be covered for that rare case where something was missed.
      And that’s where title insurance comes in. Title insurance protects
      you from losses due to any possible oversight in the title process.

    title: The bigger the fee, the higher the margin.
    text: >
      Here’s one thing they definitely don’t tell you about title companies 
      when buying a house. The margins are really big. And there’s no 
      connection between the size of the fee and the quality of the search. 
      It’s more or less the same process everywhere. You can have faith 
      in pretty much all the key players. If you pay a higher fee, 
      all you get is that warm feeling that comes with making them richer.

    title: We work smarter to save you more.
    text: >
      At Smply Title, we’ve looked closely at the title process. 
      And we found that greed isn’t the only reason fees are high. 
      There’s a lot of clunky, human-driven processes that date back 
      to the era of fax machines. With a little intelligent technology, 
      we’ve gone a long way toward reducing the cost of the process, 
      and you’ll find that reflected in our pricing. We work 
      smarter to help you look smarter.
